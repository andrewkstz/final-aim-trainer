1- You must have pygame installed to run this program. I didn't have it installed so I had to do it, it's not very hard, and some people may already have it installed.

2- The hardest parts of this for me were starting, because I had to learn all about pygame and how to use it, and I have a source of a video that taught me the basics. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9VG3Pztok8&t=385s

The other hardest part was figuring out how to detect clicking on the circle. I used the variables I had(the pointer position and circle distance) to make an if statement that calculated wether or not the mouse's distance from the circle was small enough to be inside of it, along with if the mouse was clicking.

(I apologize for the quality, I was using premiere pro and I spent about an hour figuring out how to even put text on the screen)
